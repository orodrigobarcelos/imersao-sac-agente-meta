# Ad Campaign Group

Updated: Feb 23, 2026A campaign is the highest level organizational structure within an ad account and should represent a single objective for an advertiser, for example, to drive page post engagement. Setting objective of the campaign will enforce validation on any ads added to the campaign to ensure they also have the correct objective.The `date_preset = lifetime` parameter is disabled in Graph API v10.0 and replaced with `date_preset = maximum`, which returns a maximum of 37 months of data. For v9.0 and below, `date_preset = maximum` will be enabled on May 25, 2021, and any `lifetime` calls will default to `maximum` and return only 37 months of data.

### Limits


- You can only create 200 ad sets per ad campaign. [Learn more about the ad campaign structure](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/ad-campaign-group).
- If your campaign has more than 70 ad sets and uses [Campaign Budget Optimization](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/bidding/guides/campaign-budget-optimization), you are not able to edit your current bid strategy or turn off CBO. [Learn more in the Business Help Center⁠](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/519856662172206).


### New Required Field for All Campaigns

All businesses using the Marketing API must identify whether or not new and edited campaigns belong to a [Special Ad Category](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/audiences/special-ad-category). Current available categories are: [housing, employment, credit](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/audiences/special-ad-category#context), or issues, elections, and politics. Businesses whose ads do not belong to a Special Ad Category must indicate NONE or send an empty array in the `special_ad_categories` field.Businesses running **housing**, **employment**, or **credit** ads must comply with [targeting and audience restrictions](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/audiences/reference/targeting-restrictions). Targeting for ads about social issues, elections or politics are not affected by the `special_ad_categories` label.As of **Marketing API 7.0**, the `special_ad_category` parameter on the [`POST /act_<ad_account_id>/campaigns`](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/ad-account/campaigns#Creating) endpoint has been deprecated and replaced with a new `special_ad_categories` parameter. The new `special_ad_categories` parameter is required and accepts an array.If you use the `special_ad_category` parameter, it will still return a string, but you should use `GET /{campaign-id}?fields=special_ad_categories` to get an array back. Refer  to [Special Ad Category](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/audiences/special-ad-category) for additional information.

## Reading

A campaign is a grouping of ad sets which are organized by the same business objective. Each campaign has an objective that must be valid across the ad sets within that campaign.After your ads begin delivering, you can query stats for ad campaigns. The statistics returned will be unique stats, deduped across the ad sets. You can also get reports and statistics for all ad sets and ads in an campaign simultaneously.

## Updating


### /{campaign_id}


You can update a [Campaign](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/ad-campaign-group) by making a POST request to [/{campaign_id}](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/ad-campaign-group).


#### Parameters


| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| adlabels list\<Object\> | Ad Labels associated with this campaign |
| adset_bid_amounts JSON object {numeric string : int64} | A map of child adset IDs to their respective bid amounts required in the process of toggling campaign from autobid to manual bid |
| adset_budgets array\<JSON object\> | An array of maps containing all the non-deleted child adset IDs and either daily_budget or lifetime_budget, required in the process of toggling between campaign budget and adset budget adset_id numeric string adset_id required daily_budget int64 daily_budget lifetime_budget int64 lifetime_budget Show child parameters |
| bid_strategy enum{LOWEST_COST_WITHOUT_CAP, LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP, COST_CAP, LOWEST_COST_WITH_MIN_ROAS} | Choose bid strategy for this campaign to suit your specific business goals. Each strategy has tradeoffs and may be available for certain optimization_goal s: LOWEST_COST_WITHOUT_CAP : Designed to get the most results for your budget based on your ad set optimization_goal without limiting your bid amount. This is the best strategy if you care most about cost efficiency. However with this strategy it may be harder to get stable average costs as you spend. This strategy is also known as automatic bidding . Learn more in Ads Help Center, About bid strategies: Lowest cost ⁠ . LOWEST_COST_WITH_BID_CAP : Designed to get the most results for your budget based on your ad set optimization_goal while limiting actual bid to your specified amount. With a bid cap you have more control over your cost per actual optimization event. However if you set a limit which is too low you may get less ads delivery. If you select this, you must provide a bid cap in the bid_amount field for each ad set in this ad campaign. Note: during creation this is the default bid strategy if you don't specify. This strategy is also known as manual maximum-cost bidding . Learn more in Ads Help Center, About bid strategies: Lowest cost ⁠ . COST_CAP : Designed to get the most results for your budget based on your ad set optimization_goal while limiting actual average cost per optimization event to a specified amount. Get specified cost cap in the bid_amount field for each ad set in this ad campaign. Learn more in Ads Help Center, About bid strategies: Cost Cap ⁠ . Notes: If you do not enable campaign budget optimization, you should set bid_strategy at ad set level. TARGET_COST bidding strategy has been deprecated with Marketing API v9 . |
| budget_rebalance_flag boolean | Whether to automatically rebalance budgets daily for all the adsets under this campaign. |
| campaign_optimization_type enum{NONE, ICO_ONLY} | campaign_optimization_type |
| daily_budget int64 | Daily budget of this campaign. All adsets under this campaign will share this budget. You can either set budget at the campaign level or at the adset level, not both. |
| execution_options list\<enum{validate_only, include_recommendations}\> | Default value: Set An execution setting validate_only : when this option is specified, the API call will not perform the mutation but will run through the validation rules against values of each field. include_recommendations : this option cannot be used by itself. When this option is used, recommendations for ad object's configuration will be included. A separate section recommendations will be included in the response, but only if recommendations for this specification exist. If the call passes validation or review, response will be {"success": true} . If the call does not pass, an error will be returned with more details. These options can be used to improve any UI to display errors to the user much sooner, e.g. as soon as a new value is typed into any field corresponding to this ad object, rather than at the upload/save stage, or after review. |

### Objectives and Creative Fields

See our [ads guide⁠](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/) for a list of creatives supported per objective. In the API, the objective determines which [ad creatives](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/ads-api/adcreative) are valid.

| Objective | Creative Fields |
| --- | --- |
| APP_INSTALLS | object_story_id or object_story_spec |
| CONVERSIONS | object_story_id or object_story_spec Notes: If you are creating link ads not connected to a page, use the following creative fields: title , body , object_url , and image_file or image_hash . Creative cannot include link ads pointing to an app store. |
| EVENT_RESPONSES | object_story_id or object_story_spec |
| LEAD_GENERATION | object_story_id or object_story_spec |

### Objectives and Tracking Specs

Tracking specs are applied by default based on the objective specified, please see the full list of defaults by objective [here](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/tracking-specs#default).There are two important scenarios to take into account:

- Tracking pixels are not applied by default, and you must specify it explicitly when your objective is `CONVERSIONS`.
- Mobile app ads will no longer track installs or app events by default. **You must explicitly specify to track installs or app events for mobile app ads otherwise your ad will not track.**
To specify to track an install or app event, set the following in your [ad](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/adgroup):
```
tracking_specs=[{'action.type':['mobile_app_install'],'application':[{your_app_id}]},{'action.type':['app_custom_event'],'application':[{your_app_id}]}]
```


### Objective and Promoted Objects

Certain objectives require the `promoted_object` to be set in ad sets. See [Promoted Object](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/ad-promoted-object) for more information.

| Objective | Required promoted_object Fields |
| --- | --- |

| OFFER_CLAIMS | page_id |


### Objective and Placements

Certain types of ad [placements](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/audiences/reference/advanced-targeting#placement) are valid only for specific objectives or creatives. See [Business Help Center, Available ad placements for marketing objectives⁠](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/279271845888065?id=369787570424415).The table below shows some placements and their compatible objectives or creatives. You can pick a combination of those compatible placements. Note that:

- With `LEAD_GENERATION`, `device_platforms: desktop` cannot be selected together with `publisher_platforms: instagram`.
- If your objective is website traffic, `story` for `facebook_positions` does not support `destination_type: messenger`.
- If your objective is website traffic, `story` for `messenger_positions` does not support `destination_type: messenger`.

### Objective, Optimization Goal and `attribution_spec`

Use click-through and view-through attribution windows for [ad set](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/ads-commerce/marketing-api/reference/ad-campaign#Creating) to track conversions then use for ads delivery optimization. This is different from the attribution window you use for ads reporting. With `attribution_spec`, select a combination of click-through or view-through windows of 1 day or 7 days. The combinations you can use depend on your ad set’s `optimization_goal` and campaign’s `objective`.**Recommended Default `attribution_spec`**You may not have provided `attribution_spec` when you created ads sets optimized for Value Optimization. This is an optimization available for conversions, app installs, and product catalog sales objectives. In the past, we defaulted to a 1-day click through attribution window.

| Objective | Optimization Goal | Allowed Combination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CONVERSIONS, PRODUCT_CATALOG_SALES | OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS | 1-day click 7-day click 1-day click and 1-day view 7-day click and 1-day view |
| APP_INSTALLS, LINK_CLICKS | OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS | 1-day click 7-day click |
| APP_INSTALLS | APP_INSTALLS | 1-day click 1-day click and 1-day engaged-view 1-day click and 1-day view 1-day click and 1-day engaged-view and 1-day view |
| CONVERSIONS | INCREMENTAL_OFFSITE_ CONVERSIONS | Null click, Null view |

For all other `optimization_goal` and `objective` combinations, you can only use 1-day click for `attribution_spec`.

### Outcome-Driven Ads Experiences Objective Validation

From v20.0 onwards, Impressions optimization goal is deprecated for the legacy Post Engagement objective and the `ON_POST` destination_type.

#### Objective values

The following are newer objectives:

- `OUTCOME_APP_PROMOTION`
- `OUTCOME_AWARENESS`
- `OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT`
- `OUTCOME_LEADS`
- `OUTCOME_SALES`
- `OUTCOME_TRAFFIC`
These newer objectives will eventually replace the original objectives `APP_INSTALLS`, `BRAND_AWARENESS`, `CONVERSIONS`, `EVENT_RESPONSES`, `LEAD_GENERATION`, `LINK_CLICKS`, `LOCAL_AWARENESS`, `MESSAGES`, `OFFER_CLAIMS`, `PAGE_LIKES`, `POST_ENGAGEMENT`, `PRODUCT_CATALOG_SALES`, `REACH`, `STORE_VISITS`, `VIDEO_VIEWS`. We will continue supporting these original objectives throughout 2022.

#### Limitations


- Trying to duplicate existing objective campaigns to use the new objective values (`OUTCOME_APP_PROMOTION`, `OUTCOME_AWARENESS`, `OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT`, `OUTCOME_LEADS`, `OUTCOME_SALES`, `OUTCOME_TRAFFIC`) may throw an error.


#### Example

**Outcome-Driven Ads Experiences**
```
