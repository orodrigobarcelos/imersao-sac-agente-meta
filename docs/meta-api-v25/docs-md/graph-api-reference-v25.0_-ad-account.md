# Ad Account

[○](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/ad-account/#)

Represents a business, person or other entity who creates and manages ads on Facebook. Multiple people can manage an account, and each person can have one or more levels of access to an account, see [Business Manager API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/business-manager-api).


In response to Apple’s new policy, we are announcing breaking changes that will affect SDKAdNetwork, Marketing API and Ads Insights API endpoints.


To learn more about how Apple’s iOS 14.5 requirements will impact Facebook advertising, visit our Business Help Center aricles and changelog:


- [Facebook SDK for iOS, App Events API and Mobile Measurement Partners Updates for Apple's iOS 14 Requirements](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2750680505215705?id=428636648170202)
- [Facebook Pixel Updates for Apple's iOS 14 Requirements](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/721422165168355)
- [January 19, 2021 - Breaking Changes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/changelog/non-versioned-changes/jan-19-2021)


The `agency_client_declaration` field requires [Admin privileges](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/442345745885606?id=180505742745347) for all operations starting with v10.0 and will be required for all versions on May 25, 2021.


## Ad Volume



You can view the volume of ads *running or in review* for your ad accounts. These ads will count against the ads limit per page that we will enact in early 2021. Query the number of ads running or in review for a given ad account.


Ad Limit Per Page enforcement begins for when a Page reaches its ad limit enforcement date. Enforcement date can be queried [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/insights-api/ads-volume).


When a Page is at its ad limit:


- New ads (or ads scheduled to begin at that time) do not publish successfully.
- Actions on existing ads are limited to pausing and archiving until the number of ads running or in review is below the ad limit.


To see the ads volume for your ad account:

```
curl -G
  -d "access_token=<access_token>"
  "https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/act_<ad_account_ID>/ads_volume"
```


The response looks like this:

```
{"data":[{"ads_running_or_in_review_count":2}]}
```


For information on managing ads volume, see [About Managing Ad Volume](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2720085414702598).


### Running Or In Review



To see if an ad is running or in review, we check `effective_status`, `configured_status`, and the ad account's status:


- If an ad has `effective_status` of `1` - `active`, we consider it a *running* or *in review*.
- If an ad has `configured_status` of `active` and `effective_status` of `9` - `pending review`, or `17` - `pending processing` we consider it a *running* or *in review*.
- The ad can be *running* or *in review* only if the ad account status is in `1` - `active`, `8` - `pending settlement`, `9` - `in grace period`.


We also determine if an ad is running or in review based on the ad set's schedule.


- If start time is before current time, and current time is before end time, then we consider the ad running or in review.
- If start time is before current time and the ad set has no end time, we also consider it running or in review.


For example, if the ad set is scheduled to run in the future, the ads are not running or in review. However if the ad set is scheduled to run from now until three months from now, we consider the ads running or in review.


If you are using special ads scheduling features, such as *day-parting*, we consider the ad running or in review the *whole day*, not just for the part of the day when the ad starts running.


### Breakdown By Actors



We’ve added the `show_breakdown_by_actor` parameter to the `act_123/ads_volume` endpoint so you can query ad volume and ad limits-related information for each page. For more details, see [Breakdown by Actors](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/insights-api/ads-volume#breakdown-by-actors).


### Limits


| Limit | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Maximum number of ad accounts per person | 25 |
| Maximum number of people with access, per ad account | 25 |
| Maximum number of ads per regular ad account | 6,000 non-archived non-deleted ads |
| Maximum number of ads per bulk ad account | 50,000 non-archived non-deleted ads |
| Maximum number of archived ads per ad account | 100,000 archived ads |
| Maximum number of ad sets per regular ad account | 6,000 non-archived non-deleted ad sets |
| Maximum number of ad sets per bulk ad account | 10,000 non-archived non-deleted ad sets |
| Maximum number of archived ad sets per ad account | 100,000 archived ad sets |
| Maximum number of ad campaigns per regular ad account | 6,000 non-archived non-deleted ad campaigns |
| Maximum number of ad campaigns per bulk ad account | 10,000 non-archived non-deleted ad campaigns |
| Maximum number of archived ad campaigns per ad account | 100,000 archived ad campaigns |
| Maximum number of images per ad account | Unlimited |

[○](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/ad-account/#)

## Creating


To create a new ad account for your business you must specify `name`, `currency`, `timezone_id`, `end_advertiser`, `media_agency`, and `partner`. Provide `end_advertiser`, `media_agency`, and `partner`:


- They must be Facebook Page Aliases, Facebook Page ID or an Facebook app ID. For example, to provide your company as an end advertiser you specify my company or `20531316728`.
- The End Advertiser ID is the Facebook primary Page ID or Facebook app ID. Further reference to this field (for formatting and acceptable values) may be found [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/business/adaccount/).
- If your ad account has no End Advertiser, Media Agency, or Partner, specify `NONE`.
- If your ad account has an End Advertiser, Media Agency, or Partner, that are not represented on Facebook by Page or app, specify `UNFOUND`.


**Once you set `end_advertiser` to a value other than `NONE` or `UNFOUND` you cannot change it.**


Create an ad account:

```
curl \
-F "name=MyAdAccount" \
-F "currency=USD" \
-F "timezone_id=1" \
-F "end_advertiser=<END_ADVERTISER_ID>" \
-F "media_agency=<MEDIA_AGENCY_ID>" \
-F "partner=NONE" \
-F "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<BUSINESS_ID>/adaccount"
```


If you have an extended credity line with Facebook, you can set `invoice` to `true` and we associate your new ad account to this credit line.


The response:

```
{
  "id": "act_<ADACCOUNT_ID>",
  "account_id": "<ADACCOUNT_ID>",
  "business_id": "<BUSINESS_ID>",
  "end_advertiser_id": "<END_ADVERTISER_ID>",
  "media_agency_id": "<MEDIA_AGENCY_ID>",
  "partner_id": "NONE"
}
```
You can make a POST request to `product_audiences` edge from the following paths:

- [`/act_{ad_account_id}/product_audiences`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/ad-account/product_audiences/)
When posting to this edge, an [AdAccount](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/ad-account/) will be created.
